/* NOTES:

    1. If the NSHumanReadableCopyright string is changed, corresponding changes must be made in helper.m and BuildAppsAndDmgs.sh.
       To facilitate this, search the project in Xcode for TUNNELBLICK_COPYRIGHT_NOTICE_YEAR.

    2. Because the string is localized, the new string must be uploaded to Crowdin for translation with the upbase script.
